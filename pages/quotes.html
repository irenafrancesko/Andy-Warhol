<p><em>&quot;They always say  time changes things, but you actually have to change them yourself.&quot;</em></p>
	
<p><em>&quot;As soon as you stop wanting something, you get it.&quot;</em></p>
	
<p><em>&quot;Don't pay any attention to what they write about you. Just measure it in inches.&quot;</em></p>	
	
<p><em>&quot;The idea of waiting for something makes it more exciting.&quot;</em></p>
	
<p><em>&quot;I never fall apart, because I never fall together.&quot;</em></p>	
	
<p><em>&quot;I think having land and not ruining it is the most beautiful art that anybody could ever want.&quot;</em></p>
	
<p><em>&quot;It does not matter how slowly you go so long as you do not stop.&quot;</em></p>	
	
<p><em>&quot;I'm afraid that if you look at a thing long enough, it loses all of its meaning.&quot;</em></p>	
	
<p><em>&quot;Beauty is a sign of intelligence.&quot;</em></p>	
	
<p><em>&quot;An artist is someone who produces things that people don't need to have but that he - for some reason - thinks it would be a good idea to give them.&quot;</em></p>
	
<p><em>&quot;Everybody must have a fantasy.&quot;</em></p>
	
<p><em>&quot;Sometimes the little times you don't think are anything while they're happening turn out to be what marks a whole period of your life.&quot;</em></p>
	
<p><em>&quot;Sometimes people let the same problem make them miserable for years when they could just say, So what? That's one of my favorite things to say. So what.&quot;</em></p>
	
<p><em>&quot;A picture means I know where I was every minute. That's why I take pictures. It's a visual diary.&quot;</em></p>
	
<p><em>&quot;It’s not what you are that counts, it’s what they think you are.&quot;</em></p>
	
<p><em>&quot;I like boring things.&quot;</em></p>
	
<p><em>&quot;Don't think about making art, just get it done. Let everyone else decide if it's good or bad, whether they love it or hate it. While they are deciding, make even more art.&quot;</em></p>
	
<p><em>&quot;I'm not afraid to die; I just don't want to be there when it happens.&quot;</em></p>
	
<p><em>&quot;In the future, everybody will be world famous for fifteen minutes.&quot;</em></p>
	
<p><em>&quot;And your own life while it's happening to you never has any atmosphere until it's a memory.&quot;</em></p>
	
<p><em>&quot;The best thing about a picture is that it never changes, even when the people in it do.&quot;</em></p>
	
<p><em>&quot;But I always say, one's company, two's a crowd, and three's a party.&quot;</em></p>
	
<p><em>&quot;If everyone isn't beautiful, then no one is.&quot;</em></p>
	
<p><em>&quot;Isn't life a series of images that change as they repeat themselves?&quot;</em></p>
	
<p><em>&quot;You need to let the little things that would ordinarily bore you suddenly thrill you.&quot;</em></p>
	
<p><em>&quot;People need to be made more aware of the need to work at learning how to live because life is so quick and sometimes it goes away too quickly.&quot;</em></p>	
	
<p><em>&quot;There are beautiful sounds in rock. Very lazy, dreamlike noises. You can forget about the lyrics in most songs. Just dig the noise, and you've got your sound...We're musical primitives.&quot;</em></p>
	
<p><em>&quot;Everything has it's beauty but not everyone sees it.&quot;</em></p>
	
<p><em>&quot;The idea is not to live forever, it is to create something that will.&quot;</em></p>
	
<p><em>&quot;Why do people spend their time being sad when they could be happy?&quot;</em></p>
	
<p><em>&quot;It's the movies that have been running things in America ever since they were invented. They show you what to do, how to do it, when to do it, how to feel about it, and how to look how you feel about it.&quot;</em></p>
	
<p><em>&quot;When I look around today, the biggest anachronism I see is pregnancy. I just can't believe that people are still pregnant.&quot;</em></p>
	
<p><em>&quot;Security breeds stagnation.&quot;</em></p>
	
<p><em><strong>&quot;Making money is art. And working is art. And good business is the best art.&quot;</strong></em></p>
