<h2>Childhood and early life</h2>
	
<p>Born Andrew Warhola on August 6, 1928, in the neighborhood of Oakland in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Andy Warhol's parents were Slovakian immigrants. His father, Andrej Warhola, was a construction worker, while his mother, Julia Warhola, was an embroiderer. Andy had two elder brothers Paul and John Warhola. They were devout Byzantine Catholics who attended mass regularly, and maintained much of their Slovakian culture and heritage while living in one of Pittsburgh's Eastern European ethnic enclaves.
At the age of eight, Warhol contracted ‘Sydenham's chorea’ — also known as St. Vitus's Dance — a rare and sometimes fatal disease of the nervous system that left him bedridden for several months. It was during these months, while Warhol was sick in bed, that his mother, herself a skillful artist, gave him his first drawing lessons. Drawing soon became Warhol's favorite childhood pastime. He was also an avid fan of the movies, and when his mother bought him a camera at the age of nine, he took up photography as well, developing film in a makeshift darkroom he set up in their basement.</p>
	
<p>Warhol attended Holmes Elementary school and took the free art classes offered at the Carnegie Institute (now the Carnegie Museum of Art) in Pittsburgh. In 1942, at the age of 14, Warhol again suffered a tragedy when his father passed away from a jaundiced liver. Warhol was so upset that he could not attend his father's funeral, and he hid under his bed throughout the wake. Warhol's father had recognized his son's artistic talents, and in his will he dictated that his life savings go toward Warhol's college education. That same year, Warhol began at Schenley High School, and upon graduating, in 1945, he enrolled at the Carnegie Institute for Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) to study pictorial design.

<h2>Career</h2>
	
<p>After completing a degree in Pictorial Design from Carnegie Institute of Technology (now named Carnegie Mellon University) in 1949, Warhol moved to New York to pursue a career as a commercial artist. His ink drawings for various shoe advertisements garnered a lot of attention within New York’s advertising circles. He quickly gained a range of top clients from Harper’s Bazaar to Tiffany &amp; Co., and was able to display his art in the windows of department stores, such as the famous I. Miller. </p>
	
<p>In the early fifties, he turned to producing his own artwork influenced by his past experience as a commercial illustrator. Initially, Warhol started with paintings and drawings, but gradually started to incorporate photo-based techniques and screenprinting processes which were much more industrial. Advertising techniques were a great vehicle that Warhol would use to communicate with his audience because it was a language that everyone could understand. He started incorporating images of everyday American consumer life into his artwork. It was in 1956 that the Museum of Modern Art noticed and included him in his first major group show. The growing reputation of Andy Warhol grabbed the eyes of the music label ‘RCA Records’. Andy and few other artists were hired the music label to design the covers of the various albums produced by it. He was one of the very few artists to adopt the ‘Silk Screen’ printmaking process in the 1950’s decade. </p>
	
<p>Andy, who had earned enough money by 1960 through his advertisement commitments, purchased a 4-storeyed building, so that he could experiment his art on the walls of the dwelling. This unfinished, unconventional look helped him receive a lot of appreciation. </p>
	
<p>The 1960s saw an explosion in the Pop Art movement, and Andy Warhol became known as one of the key players. Andy Warhol, like other pop artists at that time, took mundane everyday objects and made them into art. The idea behind Pop Art was to provoke viewers to reevaluate these everyday objects and what they meant to our culture. Pop art presented a challenge to traditions of fine art by including imagery from popular culture such as news or advertising. It was a radical and shocking approach to art making that Warhol embraced, turning advertising, promotion, packaging, consumerism and processing into economic entities. It was during this period he produced some of his most iconic works, which combined his fascination with all things glamor and celebrity with his love affair with commercial production.
During the 1960’s Andy made iconic illustrations for a variety of objects such as, electric chairs, ‘Campbell’s Soup Cans’, and Coca-Cola bottles. He also painted famous celebrities like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_Elvises" title="Elvis Presley" target="_blank">Elvis Presley</a>, Marilyn Monroe, Marlon Brando, and <a href="https://guyhepner.com/artist/andy-warhol-art-prints-paintings/liz-taylor-andy-warhol/" title="Elizabeth Taylor" target="_blank">Elizabeth Taylor</a>. </p>
	
<p>After working as an illustrator for more than a decade, Andy ventured into filmmaking in 1963. In a span of 5 years, he made around 60 films. Noteworthy works amongst these are ‘Sleep’, ‘Empire’, and ‘Eat’.
Andy founded his own studio named ‘The Factory’ in New York during this time. Many artists, such as writers and musicians, joined hands with Andy, to become a part of his new initiative. </p>
	
<p>The 1970s were a quieter decade for Warhol, following his attempted murder in 1968 by feminist author Valerie Solanas. After multiple gunshot wounds and a close call with death, Andy Warhol shifted gears, spending less time in the overt public and more time making art across different platforms. This is the era when Andy Warhol branched out into other entrepreneurial ventures like the magazine he co-founded, Interview, which is still in publication today. He managed to earn many influential patrons during this period. Few of these famous names include John Lennon, Diana Ross, Mick Jagger, and ‘The Shah of Iran’ Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.
In 1973, he created a portrait of the Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong, which went on to become a world renowned piece of art. Six years later, Andy, along with close friend Stuart Pavar, founded the ‘New York Academy of Art’
Andy was hired by automobile giant ‘BMW’ in 1979 to paint their supercar ‘BMW M1’. Andy was the best choice the company had made, since he decided to paint on a practice model, rather than directly experiment on the full scale product. </p>
	
<p>Through the 70s and 80s, Warhol contributed film shorts to Saturday Night Live, signed with a modeling agency and designed rock album covers for bands (most notably The Rolling Stones). His artwork captured political figures, sports athletes and celebrities. His most memorable work of the time included the <a href="https://guyhepner.com/artist/andy-warhol-art-prints-paintings/mao-by-andy-warhol/" title="Mao series" target="_blank">Mao series</a>, Camouflage series, and Skulls series. </p> 
	
<p>In 1980, Andy exhibited 10 of his portraits at the Jewish Museum in New York. This collection was named ‘The Jewish Geniuses’. In 1984, he was hired by famous painter/illustrator Alexander Lolas to work on a painting exhibition, which was to be held at Milan. Andy was asked by Lolas to produce something similar to Leonardo Da Vinci’s masterpiece ‘The Last Supper’.</p>
	
<p>Warhol passed away on February 22, 1987 after the opening exhibition of The Last Supper paintings. After complaining of abdominal pain, he was scheduled for a routine gall bladder surgery in New York Hospital. He died in recovery. Behind him, Warhol left a legacy of art, film, writing and celebrity. Two years after his death, the plan to build the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh was announced, which followed the establishment of the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. His influence continues to reach far and beyond the scope of painters and printmakers, inspiring today’s generation of thinkers with the contributions he made to American culture in his lifetime.</p>
